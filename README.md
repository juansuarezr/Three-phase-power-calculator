# Three-phase-power-calculator

For running the program, make sure you have installed python in your computer and download the following libraries, if you do not have them.

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Tkinter
- Sympy

You can download them using the following commands in windows' command prompt.

- pip install pandas
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install numpy
- pip install tk
- pip install sympy

After having installed the libraries, run the file PowerCalculator.py located in the folder Power_Calculator, using python. A window with two buttons will be shown.

When you click in the option "Three-phase sinusoidal", you will have access to an interface which displays voltage and current signals of a three-phase sinusoidal system.
You can move the sliders below for changing the rms and offset values of the signals. You will see the power calculations and the interactive graphs as you change the values.

If you click the option "Three-phase non-sinusoidal", you will be asked to upload two files, with the data of voltage and current, respectively.
In the folder Example_files, there are two files which you can use for trying the program. You can use other files following the same structure as the provided files.
